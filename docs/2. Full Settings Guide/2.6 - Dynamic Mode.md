# 2.6 - Dynamic Mode

## Overview
This section is for advanced users. It lets you create complex animations for position, rotation, color, and opacity that loop over time.

Most options use this format:<br>
```(start_value) *=> (target_value_1, time_1, easing_1) => (target_value_2, time_2, easing_2) => ...```

+ `(start_value)`: The value at the beginning of the animation loop.
+ `(target_value, time, easing)`: The animation's step.
  + `target_value`: The value to animate towards.
  + `time`: The duration (in seconds) to reach the target value.
  + `easing`: An index number for an animation curve. 0 is linear (a constant speed).

The animation loops forever. After reaching the last step, it snaps back to the `(start_value)`.

## Available Dynamic Types
`Enable Dynamic Rotation`: Animates the 3D Rotation X and Y values.
> Format: ```(x0, y0) *=> (x1, y1, t1, i1) => ...```

<br><br>
`Enable Dynamic Position`: Animates the visualizer's position on the screen (based on scene resolution).
> Format: ```(px0, py0) *=> (px1, py1, t1, i1) => ...```

<br><br>
`Enable Dynamic Opacity (Alpha)`: Animates the overall opacity. Opacity in the range [0, 1]
> Format: ```(a0) *=> (a1, t1, i1) => ...```
 
<br><br>
`Enable Dynamic Color`: This is the most complex dynamic option, with three types:
1. `Dynamic Type: Based on strength (each bar)`: This creates a gradient where each bar's color changes based on its own height.
   > Format: ```(r0, g0, b0, stop_point0) => (r1, g1, b1, stop_point1) => ...```
   
   > `stop_point` represents % height of the bar and it has a value in the range [0, 1]. 
   
   > Note: For the `Dynamic Color: Based on strength` mode, the format starts with `=>` instead of `*=>` like other types.<br>The color change is based on height. This is a value-based type, not a loop type. Therefore, the `stop_point` is only allowed to increase and must not decrease.

2. `Dynamic Type: Based on strength (all bars)`: This changes all bars to a single color based on the average volume of the music. It uses the same gradient format as above, but the stop_point is based on average volume.

3. `Dynamic Type: Based on time`: This animates the color over time, just like Dynamic Rotation/Position.
   > Format: ```(r0, g0, b0) *=> (r1, g1, b1, t1, i1) => ...```

## Examples

### Dynamic Rotation

> ```(0, 0) *=> (0, 60, 2, 6) => (0, 0, 2, 6) => (60, 0, 2, 6) => (0, 0, 2, 6) => (45, 45, 2, 6) => (0, 0, 2, 6)```


### Dynamic Position

> ```(1920, 1080) *=> (1920, 1200, 1, 6) => (1920, 1080, 1, 6)```

### Dynamic Opacity

> ```(1) *=> (0.2, 1, 6) => (1, 1, 6)```

### Dynamic Color: Based on strength (each bar)

> ```(255,255,255,0) => (138, 237, 123, 0.3) => (230, 232, 95, 0.6) => (237, 115, 109, 0.8)```

### Dynamic Color: Based on strength (all bars)

> ```(255,255,255,0) => (138, 237, 123, 0.1) => (230, 232, 95, 0.2) => (237, 115, 109, 0.25)```

### Dynamic Color: Based on time

> ```(255,255,255) *=> (62, 197, 250, 1, 0) => (247, 129, 111, 1, 6) => (255, 255, 255, 2, 6)```
