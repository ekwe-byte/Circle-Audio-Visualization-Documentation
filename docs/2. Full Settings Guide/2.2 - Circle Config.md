# 2.2 - Circle Config

`Circle Size`: Sets the static size (diameter) of the circle.

>  ⚠️ *`Circle Size` only works when `Enable Dynamic Circle Size` is NOT enabled. If `Enable Dynamic Circle Size` is enabled, it will be overridden by `Min / Max Circle Size (Dynamic)`.*

`Enable Dynamic Circle Size`: Make the entire circle pulse (get bigger and smaller) with the music's average volume.

`Smoothing Type (Dynamic)`: Controls how the pulsing effect is smoothed.
+ `Moving Average`: Very smooth, but slightly less responsive. ***<sup>(A recommended setting)</sup>***
+ `Lerp`: Very responsive and light on performance.

`Smoothing Value / Data Size`: Controls the amount of smoothing. Higher values = smoother, less "jittery" pulsing.

`Min / Max Circle Size (Dynamic)`: Sets the size limits for the pulsing effect. The circle won't get smaller than the min or larger than the max.

`Scale Value (Dynamic)`: A multiplier for the pulsing strength.

`Arc`: Controls how much of the circle is drawn. (360 is a full circle. 180 is a semi-circle. 270 is a 3/4 circle.)

`Circle Rotation Offset`: Defines the initial orientation of the circular layout.
