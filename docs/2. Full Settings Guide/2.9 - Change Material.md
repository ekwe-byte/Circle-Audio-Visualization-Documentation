# 2.9 - Change Material

1. Drag and drop your image into the Wallpaper Engine editor.

<br><br><br>

2. Delete the unused layer (the layer automatically added by Wallpaper Engine).

3. Re-select the asset, then scroll all the way down to the Materials section.

4. Click on the texture preview box.

<br><br><br>

5. Select `Browse`.
![2.9.6](../../images/2.9.6.jpg)
<br><br><br>

6. Select `your image`.

7. Select `Ok`.

<br><br><br>

![2.9.8](../../images/2.9.8.jpg)
<br><br>
With the default settings, it doesn't look good... so we need to change the settings.

There are too many bars, so I will decrease the number (64 -> 8).

![2.9.3](../../images/2.9.3.jpg)
<br><br><br>
Also, I reduce the parameter to a reasonable value so it becomes smaller.

![2.9.1](../../images/2.9.1.jpg)
<br><br><br>
Since that image is a square, I need it to stretch across both height and width. Therefore, I will enable Scale X and adjust its value to a reasonable amount.

![2.9.2](../../images/2.9.2.jpg)
<br><br><br>
### And this is the final result!
